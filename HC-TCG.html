            <p>
                HC-TCG is my attempt to recreate the Hermitcraft trading card game. Originally created by the Youtuber VintageBeef
                 in Minecraft with pixel art, his fans made an online version so other people could play. I was inspired by their idea,
                 and at the time I needed a way to practice my programming for the AP tests. I started the projects with no real 
                 expectations but it quickly became my way to find something to do. I would figure out one feature or bug then do 
                 other work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is made in Java and completely text-based. At the time, I had no knowledge of how to make images work in
                 programming so I printed out any data the players needed. The board is a 2D array with each slot in the grid being 
                 used for different types of cards. Players input numbers based off a given list to make descisions in play.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ul class="">
                <li class="list">I programmed the project using the IDE BlueJ. It was what I was familiar with at the time and was using in class.</li>
                <li class="list">When building the structure, I started from the smallest base for a card based game, being what is a card and what
                 are the different types of cards.</li>
                <li class="list">Then I built out from there with the deck and hand for the cards to go into, including random pulling from the database
                    containing all the cards as objects.</li>
                <li class="list">The last things I made were the board and the player. I had to know what a player <em>could</em> do before figuring out 
                    how to code it.</li>
                <li class="list">Once I got the main structure of the game working, I spent the remainder of my time debugging and working out problems 
                    and things that weren't running smoothly when playing.
