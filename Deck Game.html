                Deck Game is a project I made in a software development class with my partner Kurtis. It's inspired by a mix of the battle systems from
                 the Pokemon vdeo games and the trading card games. Containing 34 unique cards covering 4 different types, and a random card draw system, each game
                 is a unique matchup between two players.

                The game is made in Python and Pygame. Including a full frontend user interface for dragging and interacting with
                 the cards and systems to cover almost any result or matchup in the game.

            <p>
                The project started with deciding what the types of cards would be. Taking inspiration from the Pokemon games, there would be the creatures themselves,
                 skills to represent the moves, effects to change the boardstate, and items to cause instant changes to the game. Each type of card is built off of the
                 common traits shared between them all. Cards are drawn into a deck, then further into the player's hand. Over the course of the project, the structure
                 used to hold the cards changed several times as we found limitations as we worked. It started with just a couple lists but turned into a combination of
                 dictionaries and lists of tuples.
